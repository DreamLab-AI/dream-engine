// Ledger row contract validator — dream-cycle 2026-09-06, deep: ledger-signals.
// Enforces the machine-readable invariants of docs/dream-cycle/LEDGER.md rows:
// finding is concrete and self-contained (<= 80 chars, no pointers, no
// frozen-hypothesis leakage); prior-night fates are token-only (#N:FATE with
// FATE in MERGED|CLOSED|OPEN|STALE); ACCEPT rows track a PR and carry a witness.
// Rows dated before `enforceFrom` are grandfathered.
//
// This module is the single source of the row vocabulary. `index.ts` imports
// these constants rather than restating them, because a validator that
// disagrees with the verifier is worse than neither.

 *
 * The distinction is load-bearing downstream, not cosmetic: the engine counts
 * INCONCLUSIVE rows toward the dry streak that parks a repo, and ignores any
 * other token. Filing an operator handoff as INCONCLUSIVE therefore pushes the
 * repo toward being parked on the strength of work that was never attempted.
 *
 * - BLOCKED-ENV: the environment prevented the night from running at all.
